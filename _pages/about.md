I am a post graduate researcher at the [Department of Informatics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics) at [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/),currently undertaking a PhD as part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Digital Twins](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/dt4health-cdt).

I am interested in the conversions around DSML, digital twins and simulation models of healthcare operational systems, specifically those involving medical technology utilisation and circularity. 

Supervisory by: [Dr. Steffen Zschaler](https://steffen-zschaler.de/) and Dr. Emmanuel Akinluyi

Prior to this, I obtained a master’s in Clinical Sciences (Clinical Engineering) at King’s College London and a bachelors in Engineering at The Open University. 

Outside of work, I am most likely to be found swimming or trying my hand at something musical.
