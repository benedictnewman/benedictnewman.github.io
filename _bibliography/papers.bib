  abstract={Pulsed wave (PW) Doppler ultrasound is routinely used in the
               clinic to assess blood flow. Our annual Doppler quality
               assurance tests revealed unexpectedly large errors in
               measurement of maximum velocity, exceeding our tolerance (error
               >20\%), when using certain scanners with small Doppler sample
               volume dimensions. The aim of this study was to assess the
               dependence of maximum velocity estimates on PW Doppler sample
               volume size. A flow phantom with known steady flow was used to
               acquire maximum velocity estimates (maximum velocities of 24, 39
               and 85 cm/s and sample volume range of 0.3-20 mm) with a variety
               of transducers and scanners in clinical use (51 probes from 4
               manufacturers). Selected acoustic outputs were characterized
               using free-field hydrophone measurements. All maximum velocity
               estimates were within our tolerance for sample volume sizes
               $\geq$1.5 mm, although maximum velocity estimates typically
               increased with decreasing sample volume size. Errors exceeding
               our tolerance were commonly found for one manufacturer when
               using smaller sample volumes, resulting in up to 75\%
               overestimation. Although intrinsic spectral broadening based on
               transit time considerations may help explain our findings, the
               sample volume dependence raises potential clinical concerns that
               users should be aware of and which manufacturers should consider
               addressing},

  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
